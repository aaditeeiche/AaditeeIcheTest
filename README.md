# AaditeeIcheTest
Diginique-IITR Full Stack Web Development'23 Test

Please find attached .txt file containing answers to Theory Questions in the Test (Added to MASTER branch)
[Theory_Answers_Aaditee_Iche.txt](https://github.com/aaditeeiche/AaditeeIcheTest/files/11779020/Theory_Answers_Aaditee_Iche.txt)

IMP: Files for Practical 1 and 2 (HTML, JS and React App) have been added to MASTER branch using GitBash. 
**Although I had uploaded all the project files well in time, there was an issue from Github's side where Project 2: admission-form folder in the repo was moved to a submodule and was inaccessible. I have fixed the issue now and the files are accissible again. Apologies for any inconvinience caused and hope that you understand the situation.**

NOTE: I have uploaded the txt file instead of writing the answers directly in the README.md since text formatting here was glitching when HTML tags were included in Question 2's Answer.
